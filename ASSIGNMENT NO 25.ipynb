    "An iterator is an object which it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuples, sets, etc. It follows lazy evaluation, so it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at the same time will not be there. It is created using the iter function() on an iterable object. next() function is used to call the next element of an iterator object.\n",

    "Generators are an another way of creating iterators in a simple way where it uses the keyword yield statement instead of return statement in a defined function. Generators are implemented using a function. Just as iterators, generators also follow lazy evaluation. Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they won’t store the entire sequence in the memory.\n",
